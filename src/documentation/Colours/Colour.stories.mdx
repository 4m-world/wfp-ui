import ColorList from './ColourList';

<ColourDocs />

<Color color="support-01" />
Use the error colour to indicate an error or to focus the attention on something
which is crucial to see. Paired with a cross icon, red delivers the message that
something went wrong.

<Color color="support-02" />

Use green to indicate success state. Paired with a checkmark icon the user
knows that the operation was successfully completed.

<Color color="support-03" />

Use yellow to indicate a transient warning which is less important than an
error message. Yellow typically consists of items which require the user’s
immediate attention, or indicate a waiting period. Although this overlaps with
the use of red, yellow is more transient in nature.

### Symbolic colours

<ColorList filter="symbolic" />

### Usage

The colours can be used via JavaScript or different frameworks.

> #### Usage in JavaScript
>
> ```
> // Import colours as json (needs a json loader)
> import colors from '@wfp/ui/source/globals/data/colors.json'
>
> // Import colours as js
> import colors from '@wfp/ui/source/globals/data/colors.js'
>
> const barChartColor = colors.navy;
> ```

Setting colour variables makes it easy to reuse colours, without the hassle of updating every single Hex colour code once they change.

> #### Usage in scss
>
> ```
> // Only use variables
> @import "~@wfp/ui/source/globals/scss/vars";
>
> body {
> background: \$ui-02;
> }
> ```
