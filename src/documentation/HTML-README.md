This is a html-only preview of a component. You can see the html in the **`CODE`** tab.
In most cases you can also use the generated html code of the React components via your Browsers Inspector. Make sure you have embeeded the CSS of the UI Kit in your web project.

### Usage with Google Chrome

Download the [Google Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/). Right-click on any component, click **`Inspect`**, and you'll see the html of that component which can be copied and reused.
