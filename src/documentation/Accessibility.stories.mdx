Accessible design not only helps users with disabilities; it provides
better user experiences for everyone. All components follow the _WCAG AA standards_.

All patterns are perceivable, operable, and understandable to users,
even when using a screen reader or other assistive technology. However,
how you use these elements also affects the accessibility of a product.
