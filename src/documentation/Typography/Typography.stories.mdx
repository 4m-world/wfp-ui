WFP's visual identity uses a single font family. Like the logo,
WFP blue and the colour pallete, this font is characterizing element of WFP's brand.

### Typefaces

Open Sans is the typeface for user interfaces; itâ€™s a round, humanist
sans-serif, with incredibly warm appeal. It can be used for both headlines and
paragraphs alike, as well as for interface elements.

### How to use it

Open Sans is already included in the WFP UI's CSS. If you don't want to
include the font you can use set{' '}
**\$css--font-face: false;** inside scss.

### Other languages & styles

Open Sans provides various font styles and special language character sets,
which can be found on [Open Sans on fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans)

### DNS Naming

## Default formating

## Headings

Headings help to add a hierarchy to a page, and they are key identifiers for
users reading a page. They should be used in an order that is relevant to the
content of a page.
