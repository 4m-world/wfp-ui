All new internal appplications should use react.js as the underlying framework.
Please see the official [Software-solutions-technology-stack](https://newgo.wfp.org/documents/software-solutions-technology-stack) for more details.

### Internal applications: Create-React-App

We do encourage you to start with the official [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) tool.
It lets you create a project with a solid build setup, with no configuration needed on your part.

### External websites: next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a modern front-end development web framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications.
The combination of server side rendering and client side hydration allows the creation of very performant websites. It can be easily connected to headless content management systems like Drupal or Wordpress.
