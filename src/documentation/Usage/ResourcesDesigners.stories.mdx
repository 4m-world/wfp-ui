> <strong>We are working on a <a href="https://www.sketch.com/s/421befd7-29f6-4fe9-9dae-7d2bce93e1af" target="_blank">new version</a> of the Sketch library</strong>, which will live and progress alongside the official library until the porting is finalised. If you would like to try it out, <a href="sketch://add-library/cloud/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sketch.com%2Fs%2F421befd7-29f6-4fe9-9dae-7d2bce93e1af">add the library to Sketch</a> and <strong>share your feedback</strong> by leaving comments on the library directly or by <a href="https://github.com/wfp/ui-design-kit/issues/1" target="_blank">using this thread</a>, so that we know that what we are building is actually useful for you. Thank you!
