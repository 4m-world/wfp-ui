> The following guidelines assume that you have already installed the Kit. If you haven't done it yet, please check our [step-by-step guide on how to install the Kit]().

## The components
Let's pretend you want to use the `Button` component: you first need to import it through the `import` function, then to call that component through its name.

```jsx
// Import the Button component
import { Button } from '@wfp/ui';

// Use the Button component
<Button>Button label</Button>
```

If you don't want to load the CSS globally but you want to include only this stylesheet, then use:
```jsx
// Import the Button component and its style
import { Button } from '@wfp/ui';
import '@wfp/ui/src/components/Button/button.scss';

// Use the Button component
<Button>Button label</Button>
```

## The templates
The Kit provides with the code for different templates:
- Application page
- Dashboard page

## Usage with vanilla JS

The JS components are built using React, but that does not limit their usage
to just React applications. You can render any component in any JavaScript
application with ReactDOM.render. Think of it like using a jQuery plugin.
Make sure you have embedded the CSS of the UI Kit in your project.

```js
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Button } from '@wfp/ui';

const myContainerElement = document.getElementById('container');

// with JSX
ReactDOM.render(<Button>Simple Button</Button>, myContainerElement);

// with vanilla JS, use React.createElement
ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement(Button, {
    className: Classes.SMALL,
    children: 'Simple button',
  }),
  myContainerElement
);
```
To remove the component from the DOM and clean up, unmount it:
```
ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(myContainerElement);
```

Check out the [React API docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html) for more details.

## Usage with pure HTML
We have included the HTML of every template and every component in this documentation: navigate through the item of your interest, search for a preview of the component or template, click on the HTML tab. For what concerns the styling, you can [load the CSS through the WFP CDN](). We are currently evaluating to expose the CSS for the single components and templates.

## Using the Kit SCSS

When using scss you can import the SCSS sources from the node_module.
This allows you to use only parts of the SCSS, reuse common variables
and functions from WFP UI or to override settings.

```css
// Sample overriding settings
$input-border-radius: 5px;
$button-border-radius: 60px;
$button-font-size: 25px;
$button-padding: 10px 25px;
// new css variables used for colours
--interactive-01: #0076FF;

// Disable css reset
$css--reset==false

// Only use variables
@import "~@wfp/ui/src/globals/scss/vars.scss";

```
