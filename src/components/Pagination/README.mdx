**Pagination** is used for splitting up content or data into several pages, with a control for navigating to the next or previous page.

Generally, pagination is used if there are too many items displayed in one view. The default number displayed will vary depending on the context.

### Usage with react
```js
import { Pagination } from '@wfp/ui';
```
