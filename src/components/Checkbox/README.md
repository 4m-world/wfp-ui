  Checkboxes are used when there is a list of options and the user may select multiple options, including all or none.
        The example below shows how the Checkbox component can be used as an uncontrolled component that is initially checked
        by setting the defaultChecked property to true. To use the component in a controlled way, you should set the
        checked property instead.
