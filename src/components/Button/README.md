Buttons express what action will occur when the user clicks or touches it. Buttons are used to initialize an action, either in the background or foreground of an experience.

Using icons with buttons
All buttons can use icons. It's recommended to inline SVG icons when possible. Simply add the appropriate <svg> to the button HTML with the bx--btn__icon class. You can also include <title> for better accessibility to describe what the button does.
