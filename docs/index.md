title: WFP UI Guidelines
---

The World Food Programme’s (WFP) [Branding Guidance](http://www.wfp.org/Branding) (PDF, 4.7MB) was published in 2009 and has now been effectively implemented across the organization, strengthening WFP's brand image through consistent representation.

Building on this initiative, the World Food Programme’s _User Interface Style Guide_ emphasizes WFP’s commitment to establish and build the brand.

The purpose of this project is to create a unified toolkit that is used by designers and developers alike on their projects to ensure all WFP-branded projects are accessible, beautiful, and have a consistent look and feel across the board by following WFP's design and implementation guidelines.

The guidelines contained in this guide are to be applied to all WFP digital products (such as: websites, web applications, internal systems and other).

The Guide is a living document created to meet the needs of WFP’s front-end developers and designers. If there is a _Component_ or _Pattern_ that you need, or you have any other feedback, question or comment please contact [wfp.publications@wfp.org](mailto:WFP.PUBLICATIONS@wfp.org?subject=UI%20Style%20Guide).
