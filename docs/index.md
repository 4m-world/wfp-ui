title: WFP UI Style Guide
---

WFP UI is a library of components, patterns, and a style guide for WFP-branded websites and web applications.

The purpose of this project is to create a unified toolkit that could be used by designers and developers alike on their projects, by following our design and implementation guidelines, to ensure all WFP-branded projects are accessible, beautiful, and have a consistent look and feel across the board.

These components and patterns follow industry-standard accessibility guidelines for websites and web applications, and are maintained by WFP Communications Division (WFP COM).
